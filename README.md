# My Obsidian Vault for CompTIA Network+ N10-009

This repository contains my personal Obsidian vault for studying for the [CompTIA Network+ N10-009 Exam](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) and serves as both a study resource and a backup of my notes.

## How to Use This Repository

- **On GitHub:**  
  Click the links below to navigate the markdown files directly on GitHub.

- **In Obsidian:**  
  Open the repository folder as a vault in Obsidian. Obsidian supports internal wiki-links (using `[[...]]`) so you can navigate your notes easily. For example, inside Obsidian, you can link to a note like:  
  `[[01_Networking-Concepts/1.1 – OSI Model Concepts/1.1 – OSI Model Concepts]]`  
  *Note: While GitHub doesn’t render these double-bracket links as clickable links, they are fully functional within Obsidian.*

## Objective Map

- [01_Networking-Concepts](./01_Networking-Concepts/Networking-Concepts.md)
- [02_Networking-Implementation](./02_Networking-Implementation/Networking-Implementation.md)
- [03_Network-Operations](./03_Network-Operations/Network-Operations.md)
- [04_Network-Security](./04_Network-Security/Network-Security.md)
- [05_Network-Troubleshooting](./05_Network-Troubleshooting/Network-Troubleshooting.md)

## Tips for Using This Vault in Obsidian

- **Internal Links:**  
  Use Obsidian’s internal linking format for seamless navigation. For example, to open the note on OSI Model, type:  
  `[[01_Networking-Concepts/2.1 – Characteristics of Routing Technologies/2.1 – Characteristics of Routing Technologies]]`

- **Search & Graph View:**  
  Leverage Obsidian’s search and graph view features to discover connections between topics.

This vault is a personal study resource and might include personal study notes, resources, and external links that I find helpful.
